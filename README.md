I'm a Developer looking for a role in a start-up environment, with a particular interest in machine learning.

 I studied Maths at university for one year, and decided it wasn't really what I wanted, although I still enjoy doing maths when I get time. Coding is able to fill the problem-solving void in my life, plus, I get to create awesome programs with the code I write. The most enjoyable part of coding to me is writing a beautiful piece of code that is as efficient as possible, using all the principles I have studied.

## Skills

#### Unstoppable

You won't often find people raving about the fact they dropped out of university posted all over their CVs. Leaving University was a difficult decision for me, it left me in London with no qualifications, job or help. Being completely independent from the age of 19, I've had to work hard to get to where I am already, and have absolutely no desire to stop now. When I set myself a task there is little to nothing that can stand in my way.

#### Problem Solving

My Favourite aspect of coding
