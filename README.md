## Raefe Newton-Jones

I am a Software Engineer looking for a full-stack role in a company with a passionate mission-focused team. The most enjoyable part of coding to me is writing a beautiful piece of code that is as efficient and succinct as possible.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving


I've always prided myself on my ability to be pragmatic. I have a strong background in Maths, and have enjoyed solving really difficult problems from a young age. In the final project at Makers Academy, I faced many high-level problems. With no prior knowledge of Machine Learning we were able to test-drive three bots. One particular problem I overcame during the course was to create instant messaging functionality using websockets and actioncable in a Rails app.

#### Communication

In year 12 I was part of the Young Enterprise Program, I was voted by people of my own age and a year older to represent the company as Managing Director, this involved a level of public speaking, and management within the team. I was made vice captain of the City water polo team in Dundee within the first few weeks playing for the club.

#### Unstoppable

You won't often find people raving about the fact they dropped out of university posted all over their CVs. Leaving University was a difficult decision for me, it left me in London with no qualifications, job or help. Being completely independent from the age of 19, I've had to work hard to get to where I am already, and have absolutely no desire to stop now. When I set myself a task there is little to nothing that can stand in my way.
