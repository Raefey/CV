I'm a Developer looking for a backend role in a start-up with a passionate mission-focused team, with a particular interest in Machine Learning and Fintech. The most enjoyable part of coding to me is writing a beautiful piece of code that is as efficient and succinct as possible.


## Projects
| Project  | Summary | Technologies |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|1. [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/Raefey/FinalProjectML)  | Our final project at Makers Academy, which explored Machine Learning, we created bots to detect cancerous tumours and diabetes. We went into the week with no experience in machine learning and were able to test drive all the bots with 100% coverage,  | Python, Unittest, Tensorflow |
|2. [Acebook](https://github.com/Raefey/acebook-dart)  | A two week group project to create a clone of Facebook  | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, JQuery, Postgres, Heroku  |
|3. [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Raefey/bank-tech-test)  | A practice tech test, simulating a Bank, focusing on the bank statement  | Ruby, RSpec |
|4. [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/Raefey/bowling-challenge)  | A bowling-score calculator, I was proud of this project as I used a really interesting recurring method  | Javascript, Jasmine |
|5. [Thermostat](https://github.com/Raefey/thermostat-challenge)  | A simulation of a Thermostat, with a interactive web page, built in my first week of Javascript  | Javascript, Jasmine, JQuery  |
|6. [Oystercard Challenge](https://github.com/Raefey/oystercard)  | The content of my second week of the Makers Academy course, a simulation of the Oystercard system  | Ruby, RSpec  |

## Skills

#### Unstoppable

You won't often find people raving about the fact they dropped out of university posted all over their CVs. Leaving University was a difficult decision for me, it left me in London with no qualifications, job or help. Being completely independent from the age of 19, I've had to work hard to get to where I am already, and have absolutely no desire to stop now. When I set myself a task there is little to nothing that can stand in my way.

#### Problem Solving


I've always prided myself on my ability to be pragmatic. I have a rich background in Maths, and have enjoyed solving really difficult problems since a young age. In the final project at Makers Academy, I faced many high-level problems, with no prior knowledge of Machine Learning we were able to test-drive three bots. One particular problem I overcame, was increasing the accuracy of the bot, I realised that the learning rate, and the hidden layers that we had set worked for a small dataset like the first we used, but were not adept to deal with much larger datasets.
